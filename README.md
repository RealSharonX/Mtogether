Mtogether is a website and bot created when twitch streamers. Started getting DMCA strikes on their VODs due to music. Mtogether (short for music together) would detect spotify music playing on the streamer's pc through a discord bot created by Amine-Zitoun and the send the data to the website I created. The website then would allow streamers to link their discord, create a room and get a unique room id. Upon entering this id by the streamers fans, they would join the same room where they will all simultaneously listen to the music played on the streamer's side through the website.  This was achieved by using node.js for the backend and socket.io.
